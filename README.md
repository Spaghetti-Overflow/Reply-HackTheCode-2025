## Summary

This repository contains all the code developed by our team for the **Reply Hack the Code 2025 Challenge**, including solutions for both the **Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges** and the **algorithmic optimization problem**.

### What is the Reply Hack the Code Challenge?

The **Reply Hack the Code Challenge** is an international team-based competition that blends **coding and cybersecurity**. Over the course of **six hours**, teams compete to solve an **algorithm-based optimization problem**, earning points by submitting solutions based on provided input files.

At the start of the competition, some input files are available by default. However, additional input files—critical for maximizing the score—can only be unlocked by completing **CTF challenges** across three categories:
- **Miscellaneous**
- **Cryptography**
- **Web Security**

These challenges test participants' skills in cybersecurity, reverse engineering, and problem-solving. A **live leaderboard** tracks progress, allowing teams to compare their performance in real time against competitors worldwide.

### When Did the Challenge Take Place?

The **2025 edition** of the challenge took place on **March 12th at 15:30 CET**, lasting for a total of **six hours**.

### Abstract

> Imagine a future in which every branch of a large global network, scattered across metropolises and small, remote centers, receives clean and sustainable energy. Each location has its own challenges: varying costs, renewable sources to integrate, and environmental conditions to respect. The goal is ambitious: to achieve energy independence with a carbon-neutral, or even negative, footprint. However, all of this with limited resources, forcing careful choices and ingenious strategies.  
> Reply takes on this challenge by following an unconventional path: through innovative technologies, creative solutions, and a long-term vision, it strives to build an energy ecosystem where nothing is wasted and every single watt can make a difference. It is a story of ingenuity and responsibility in which efficiency, sustainability, and adaptability intertwine in a global mosaic of operational sites. The stakes are high: achieving a perfect balance between demand, supply, and budget, proving that it is possible to grow, expand, and prosper without ever losing sight of the planet and future generations.  
> Now, imagine having to put all this into practice: activity rounds, energy resources to balance, initial and maintenance costs, life cycles, special effects. The problem is ready to reveal its complexity and test your planning skills.
